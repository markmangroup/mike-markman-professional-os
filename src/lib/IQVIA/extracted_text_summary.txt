Launch Tracker – Kick-off March 2023 Enterprise Data & Analytics Project Overview ED&A Stakeholders BUSINESS CASE Launch Excellence CEP initiative has been established to accelerate IQVIAs $ share of launch opportunities, so in order to assess the impact of the launch Excellence CEP and track IQVIA growth on Launches the team has established a set of KPIs and created a dashboard to monitor progress. Currently Launch team is using tracker created in collaboration with IPM team but is not fully covering needs. Collaboration with ED&A will intend to improve look and feel of Dashboard (current Dashboard is in tabular format and not very user friendly), incorporate additional fields and calculations, feed it with data from source systems and transition to more automated data cleansing. DATA SOURCES BENEFITS Support Business Growth (RIH) in 2023 of +44M$ across Priority Launches by: Tracking IQVIA performance across Priority Launches Support key Account leads in understanding strengths and weaknesses, identifying white spaces and opportunities for further engagements/sales Project Status: Under Assessment Key Sponsor: Natalie Harb Process Owners: Alice Cinzia Perego, Deepa Ananthakrishnan VA SME: Anabel Sableski, Julian Shim ED&A: Carmen Tejada (PM), Catia Ferreira (Data), Matteo Fedrizzi (Analytics), Sergio Gomez and Petrana Petrova (Reporting) End Users: Around 100 Internal Users – mainly leadership team, VPs, GADs and Asset Partners. Scope Data extraction: Automate data extraction from data source systems (CRM, MRA) Data transformation: Perform data transformation/mapping as per shared business rules (Annex) Data visualization: Create dashboard that feeds from source system data based on mock-up version done by VA team (recreation of slides). Visualizations to be created for 2 personas: Leadership team/Presidents: Main KPIs tracked against previous year, size of total opportunity and established goals GAD/Asset Partners: Account performance and track it vs previous years Project management : Coordination and follow-up of project. * Project Charter provided by Launch team in Annex.

The goals of the Launch excellence CEP are: Establish IQVIA as end-to-end strategic partner for Launch planning and execution Maximize IQVIA success rate by ensuring consistency of best practices and fostering a community based on knowledge sharing Further cement IQVIA’s position as a Thought Leader in Launch Excellence In order to assess the impact of the launch Excellence CEP and track IQVIA growth on Launches the team has established a set of KPIs and created a dashboard to monitor progress . KPIs: TCV, RIH and Opportunity Counts Dashboard personas: Leadership team / Presidents: gain an overview of overall IQVIA performance across main KPIs and track it against previous years, size of total opportunity and established goals GADs/Asset Partners: gain an overview of their account performance (across priority launches and other assets) and track it vs previous years. Deep dive into asset performance and get more granularity in order to identify white spaces and opportunities for future engagements. Current Process: Pilot Dashboard has been created: Launch Revenue Tracker in collaboration with IPM team. Data sources: CRM Finance Other: Priority Assets List, with Launch dates, Launch type, and other Asset Qualifiers (excel file - analysis based on various sources e.g. Plink) Process: Tracker is refreshed at the beginning of the month and data is extracted to manually review and update the Drug classification/product name field in CRM. Post review, Drug classification/product name is fed into asset name field of the tracker. Tracker thus updated has a one-month lag in terms of CRM and finance data Expected Timeframe: Depending on the objectives we plan to have different timelines in place for resolution. Improve look and feel: V1 end of February 2023 based on VA mock-up (with adaptations where needed) – V2 Q3/Q4 2023 (including visualizations for the two personas) Access to data sources: ASAP at project start Production strategy: in parallel to dashboard development and ready before first release. QC and data maintenance: on-going throughout Add on: Transition to more automated data cleaning: Q2/Q3 2023 Project Team & Stakeholders: Sponsor: Natalie Harb Process Owner: Alice Cinzia Perego, Deepa Ananthakrishnan Facilitator: Carmen Tejada, Ayreen Marin Development  and on-going solution management: ED&A Team Participants: Sableski, Anabel (VA SME) End Users: Around 100 Internal Users – mainly leadership team, VPs, GADs and Asset Partners. LAUNCH Project Lean Project Charter {5C22544A-7EE6-4342-B048-85BDC9FD1C3A} Problem Statement: Elevate the current solution and production process to meet/align to the outlined project goals. Objectives Improve look and feel of the dashboard: current dashboard is in tabular format, not very user friendly and requires improvements in data visualization, filtering and lexicon harmonization. In addition, we are considering incorporating additional fields. We are currently working with the VA team to develop a mock-up version that will have to be adjusted and productionised . Risk: the VA team doesn’t have access to the underlying data source which makes output     validation challenging and hinders mock-up development. Mitigation: Grant access to the source system to the VA team Risk: Final layout of the dashboard not yet finalized due to evolving scope and business objectives. In addition, some parameters (such as Priority Launches) that impact filters and data inclusion are expect to continue evolving alongside the dashboard life. Mitigation: additional development time will be required after 1 st improved version is released. Establish solution productionisation strategy. Obtain access to data sources : This currently identified as a highly critical risk . A solid connection to the underlying source(data) system will need to established and treated as a must item for the project outlined QC and data maintenance : data are updated monthly in the dashboard with frequent errors and quality issues that are not caught up when releasing it and often identified by the users Add-on workstream to be evaluated: Convert manual data cleaning into full automation : due to issues in the quality, CRM data needs to be cleaned (at the moment QC is limited to asset name field but could be extended to Account name field) before being fed into the dashboard. Current QC process is entirely manual, resource and time consuming. A separate workstream has been put in place to convert the asset name field in the CRM from open text to drop down to partially ease the process, but further controls must be put in place. Opportunity exist to explore how ED&A Team can support with this process of transition into full automation. Project Scope: Report/Dashboard Finalise and sign off reporting requirements for 2 personas. Completion of mock-up Creation of Working Live Dashboard for the 2 personas identified. Production process: Establish data refresh process. This could be fully automated or manual. To define and agree a full data scope (source, contents and structure) Version control & improvement process to be defined and agreed (On-going development resource allocation) QC Robust established process for Data QC and data feed into the Dashboard with assigned accountabilities and progressive transition into full automation. Others(Non-critical) Possibility to download data extracts and ppt from the dashboard to be used for regular updates. Prerequisites Throughout the process we expect full transparency and visibility of the data sources to the project VA SMEs Project management: due to involvement of multiple stakeholders, the ask is to have the ED&A Team to lead clarification of roles and responsibilities and take ownership of project coordination and milestones tracking. LAUNCH Project Business Case {5C22544A-7EE6-4342-B048-85BDC9FD1C3A} Estimated Tangible/Quantitative and Intangible/Qualitative Benefits of the requested solution: requested solution is expected to result in the following estimated  tangible and intangible benefits Support Business growth (RIH) in 2023 of +44M$ across Priority Launches by: Tracking IQVIA performance across Priority Launches Support key Account leads in understanding strengths and weaknesses, identifying white spaces and opportunities for further engagement/sales.
